        <h3>About Nonstagram</h3>
        <p>
          Nonstagram is a single page application for uploading images, viewing images, and commenting on images. This website is just practice project, so it is missing some features.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front end of the site uses Vue.Js for the heavy lifting, some Buefy components, and mostly Bulma for the css styling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend is written with Node / Express, using MongoDB as the database. The MongoDB database is hosted on a MongoDB Atlas Cluster.
